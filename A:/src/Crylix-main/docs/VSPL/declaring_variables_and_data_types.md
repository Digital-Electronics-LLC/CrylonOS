# declaring vars

to declare a variable called "x" that contains the number(cannot excede 16777215) 32, you type `int x = 32;`.
the "int" keyword means integer

if you want the variable to contain a signed number, type `signed int x = -32;`. By the way, "x" can be anything, if you've not caught on yet.

# data types

the "int" data type(nums 0 - 16777215) : `int foo = 10;`

the" signed int" data type(nums -8388607 - 8388608): `signed int foo = -10;`

the "string" data type: `string foo = "hello, world!;"`

the "char" data type(chars are numbers that cannot excede 255. IDK why i added this): `char foo = 255;`

the "signed char" data type(nums -127 - 128): `signed char foo = -125`
